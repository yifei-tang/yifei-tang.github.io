                <h4>PillSafe</h4>
                <p>Technologies Used: Python, OpenCV, Tensorflow, MySQL, PyQt</p>
                <p>PillSafe is an application built to classify medication using computer vision and machine learning techniques. 
                    I developed this as part of a research internship with the National University of Singapore. Users can enter a pill into the database with a single click of the camera. Users can also remove pills and re-insert them to account for the continually changing nature of medical advances.</p>

                <h4>Onion GIS</h4>
                <p>Technologies Used: C++, GTK, Dark Sky API, Open Street Maps API</p>
                <p>A semester long mapping application dedicated towards assisting tourists in finding their way around a new city. This GIS is designed to be visually appealing and find routes efficiently! We programmed this application in a team of 3 in C++, using GTK for the GUI. Features I programmed specifically include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Webscrapping live weather data using Dark Sky API and displaying it when the map is loaded.</li>
                    <li>Using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between locations in a city.</li>
                    <li>Displaying popular locations such as restaurants, gas stations and schools with icons.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Star Catcher</h4>
                <p>Technologies Used: Verilog, PS-2 Controller, DE1-SoC Board</p>
                <p>An arcade game developed in Verilog. Object of the game is to "catch" the stars and "avoid" the asteroids with the spaceship. I worked on this project with a partner for my Digital Systems course as a final project. My role involved creating an algorithm to randomly generate stars and asteroids, as well as writing a Finite State Machine to control game state. </p>
