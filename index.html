            <h1>YiFei Tang</h1>
            <p> Hello! My name is YiFei and I am a third year Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto. I am currently actively seeking a summer 2020 software engineering internship.
            </p> 
            <p>     I have an enthusiasm for
                        software, machine learning and creating applications that make an impact on people's lives. 
                        I am especially intrigued by the ways we can adapt technologies for medical purposes.
                        
                    
                        My team recently won a $2000 dollar prize from TD Bank at Canada's biggest Hackathon, Hack the North for the best use of their
                        DaVinci API. I also won a $2000 dollar prize for second place at RBC AmpHacks.
            </p>
            <p>
                        I also did a research internship at the National University of Singapore, using 
                        machine learning and computer vision techniques to recognize medication in a database. 
            </p>

            <p> In my spare time, I am a passionate first aid and swim instructor as well as lifeguard. At the University of Toronto, I have served as the Vice President of Social and Outreach
                for Engineers Without Borders. In these roles, I have been commended for my quick thinking, professionalism and ability to work in a team.</p>
